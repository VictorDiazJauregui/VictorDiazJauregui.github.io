      I am currently studying a degree in Computer Science at the National University of CÃ³rdoba - FaMAF, where I have been able to acquire a vast and solid base of what programming is.
      In addition, the last year I have invested my time and energy in educating myself in web development, for this I have carried out online courses through the  <a className='text-[#a3aed0] underline underline-offset-1' target="_blank" href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a> platform. Thanks to these courses, I have acquired a lot of practical skills. I am excited to apply everything I have learned in these courses to my personal projects.
      <br/>
      I have also spent time improving my language skills and have taken several English courses at B1 level, which has allowed me to improve my ability to communicate in a global environment and broaden my perspective.
