# Victor Diaz's Portfolio

[Documentation in Spanish](README_es.md)

In this repository you will find my portfolio where two frontend projects are highlighted, which is what I like the most, but I'm also good at backend, however, the website created in this repository is not to highlight that.
You can access my web portfolio [here](https://aledjv22.github.io/ "here").
In addition to the projects, you can see the technologies I handle, my studies, and a little about me.
The page has a button located at the top right which, when pressed, changes the language from English to Spanish and vice versa.
I hope you like it and I am open to suggestions.
